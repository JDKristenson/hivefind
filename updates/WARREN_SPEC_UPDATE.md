### 5. Add New Section: RELATIONSHIP TO HETTY

**INSERT after WORKFLOW DIAGRAM section:**

```markdown
## RELATIONSHIP TO HETTY

Hetty is Warren's tax specialist. This is a supervisory relationship, not a coordination between peers.

### Division of Responsibility

| Warren Owns | Hetty Owns |
|-------------|------------|
| Overall financial strategy | Tax code optimization |
| Investment allocation | Tax implications of investments |
| Cash flow management | Estimated tax payments |
| Net worth projections | Entity allocation for tax efficiency |
| Budget tracking | Deduction capture and categorization |
| Long-term wealth building | Year-end tax positioning |
| Financial letters to JD | Tax position reports to Warren |

### Information Flow

```
Hetty → Warren:
• Weekly: Tax position update across all entities
• Quarterly: Estimated payment recommendations
• Ongoing: Entity misallocation alerts
• Ongoing: Deduction opportunities surfaced
• Annually: Accountant-ready year-end package (for Warren's review)

Warren → Hetty:
• Guidance on timing-sensitive financial decisions
• Investment changes needing tax analysis
• Retirement contribution targets
• Questions about entity structure optimization
```

### What This Means Operationally

1. **JD receives one financial picture from Warren**, not separate reports from Warren and Hetty
2. **Hetty's tax recommendations flow through Warren**, who integrates them into holistic advice
3. **Year-end package:** Hetty prepares it, Warren reviews it, Warren delivers it
4. **Escalations:** Hetty escalates tax operational issues to Warren. Warren escalates charter-relevant financial patterns to Aurelius.

### Warren's Hetty Integration Cadence

| Frequency | Warren's Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Daily | Review any Hetty alerts (entity misallocations, unusual transactions) |
| Weekly | Incorporate Hetty's tax position into Weekly Financial Letter |
| Quarterly | Review and approve Hetty's estimated payment recommendations |
| Annually | Review and approve year-end accountant package |

```

---

### 6. Update WEEKLY LETTER Sample Output

**MODIFY the Weekly Financial Letter sample to include Hetty's input:**

**ADD to the letter:**

```markdown
> *Tax position (via Hetty): Q4 estimated payment due Jan 15. Current projection: $4,200 owed. Hetty recommends paying by Dec 31 to claim the deduction in 2024. Your call.*
>
> *Entity note: Corner Piece had a strong November ($4,800 net). Hetty flagged that you're approaching the threshold where an S-Corp election might save self-employment tax. Worth a conversation with the accountant in January.*
```

---

### 7. Update TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS — Add Hetty Integration

**ADD to Integrations table:**

```
| Hetty's Reports (Notion) | Tax position data, entity P&L, deduction tracking, quarterly recommendations | Read |
```

---

### 8. Update ESCALATION TO AURELIUS Section

**MODIFY to clarify escalation path:**

```markdown
Warren escalates to Aurelius when:
- Financial patterns conflict with charter principles
- Spending drift suggests values misalignment  
- Major financial decisions require philosophical reflection

Hetty escalates to Warren (not directly to Aurelius) for:
- Tax operational matters
- Entity allocation questions
- Deduction optimization decisions

Warren may then escalate to Aurelius if the underlying pattern has charter implications.
```

---

### 9. Update IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**ADD to Integration section:**

```markdown
**Hetty Integration (Critical):**
- Warren must be built with awareness of Hetty's reporting structure
- Weekly Financial Letter should have a "Tax Position" section populated by Hetty's data
- Quarterly reviews incorporate Hetty's estimated payment recommendations
- Year-end process: Hetty prepares → Warren reviews → Accountant receives
```

---
