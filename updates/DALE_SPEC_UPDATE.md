### What Goes to Clare

| Content Type | Clare Review? | Reason |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| LinkedIn articles | Always | Long-form content benefits from delivery coaching |
| LinkedIn posts (standard) | Optional | Only if voice drift detected or audience-specific |
| LinkedIn posts (high-stakes) | Always | Tied to speaking events, client announcements, etc. |
| Video/audio content | Always | Delivery notes are critical |
| Newsletter | Rarely | Eleanor integration is primary focus |

### Dale's Role vs. Clare's Role

| Dale | Clare |
|------|-------|
| Creates content | Coaches delivery |
| Writes in JD's voice | Ensures voice consistency |
| Determines what to say | Optimizes how to say it |
| Measures engagement | Provides audience calibration |
| Mines source material | Reviews finished drafts |
| Owns content pipeline | Owns delivery quality |

### Clare's Deliverables to Dale

When Clare reviews content, she returns:

1. **Voice consistency check** — Does this sound like JD?
2. **Audience calibration notes** — Will this land with the intended audience?
3. **Delivery notes (if video/audio)** — How should JD present this?
4. **Ready/Not Ready assessment** — Publish as-is or revise?

Dale incorporates Clare's notes if revisions are needed, or routes directly to JD if approved.
```

- All articles route through Clare for voice consistency
- Video/audio content requires Clare's delivery notes
- Clare does not edit substance—that's JD's call
- Clare flags voice drift; Dale adjusts
- Weekly sync not required—coordination is per-content-item
```

**UPDATE Eleanor section:**

```markdown
**Eleanor (Relationship Steward):**
- Primary coordination partner for outreach
- Dale creates content; Clare coaches delivery; Eleanor weaponizes for relationships
- After content publishes, Dale identifies outreach targets, Eleanor executes

```

**ADD Helena:**

```markdown
**Helena (Business Development Manager):**
- Dale monitors engagement for warm leads

```

---
