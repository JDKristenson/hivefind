# How This Was Built

This folder documents the process of designing and building the AI Crew; an 18-agent ecosystem handling personal operations, consulting business, and e-commerce.

**Why document this?**
- Demo material for potential clients
- Source material for courses, newsletters, or content
- Reference for anyone wanting to replicate the approach
- Prevent having to reconstruct the process from memory later

## Contents

1. [**Journey Overview**](01-JOURNEY.md) - High-level timeline from concept to implementation
2. [**Design Decisions**](02-DESIGN-DECISIONS.md) - Key choices and their rationale
3. [**Spec Writing Process**](03-SPEC-WRITING.md) - How individual agent specs were developed
4. [**Lessons Learned**](04-LESSONS-LEARNED.md) - What worked, what didn't, what to do differently
5. [**For Clients**](05-CLIENT-DEMO.md) - Talking points for demonstrating the system

## Quick Summary

**Time investment:** ~40-50 hours over 4-6 weeks (thinking, writing specs, iteration)

**Tools used:**
- Claude (Claude.ai, Claude Code) for spec development and iteration
- Notion for documentation and eventually the operational hub
- n8n for workflow orchestration
- Various APIs (Shopify, Google Workspace, social platforms)

**Key insight:** The spec-writing phase is the real work. Getting the "job description" right before touching automation tools prevents expensive rework later.
