# AGENTS.md Conversion Guide for AI Crew

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for converting AI Crew agent job descriptions (like `AGENT_SPEC_Ada.md`) into the `AGENTS.md` format—a simple, open standard for guiding AI coding agents adopted by OpenAI Codex, Google Jules, Cursor, and other major AI development tools.

### Why Convert?

Your detailed agent specs are excellent for *planning* and *human understanding*. The AGENTS.md format is optimized for *AI execution*—giving coding agents exactly what they need to implement, test, and maintain your automation workflows.

---

## The AGENTS.md Philosophy

| Agent Spec (Current) | AGENTS.md (Target) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Comprehensive planning document | Lean execution guide |
| Explains *why* things work | Specifies *how* to do things |
| Human-readable narrative | Machine-actionable instructions |
| Includes success metrics | Includes verification commands |
| Organizational context | Technical context |

**Core Principle**: AGENTS.md files answer one question: *"What does an AI agent need to know to work correctly in this codebase?"*

---

## Conversion Template

Use this template when converting any agent spec to AGENTS.md format:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md – [Agent Name]

## Identity

## Section-by-Section Conversion Guide

### 1. Identity Section

**From Agent Spec:**
```markdown
## AGENT IDENTITY
**Name:** Ada

### 4. Workflows Section

**From Agent Spec:**
```markdown
## KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
| # | Responsibility | Trigger → Action → Destination |
|---|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | **Publish Daily Content** | Every weekday morning → Pull a featured product from Shopify, generate a platform-native post... |
```

**To AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
## Workflows

### Daily Content Publishing
**Trigger**: Weekday mornings (schedule: 0 8 * * 1-5)  
**Cadence**: 4x/week IG, 3x/week FB, 2x/week LI, 3x/week TT

```
1. Query Shopify for featured product (rotate categories, prioritize new arrivals)
2. Generate caption in Ada voice (max 3 emojis, 5-8 hashtags for IG)
3. Resize image for platform specs:
   - Instagram: 1080x1080 (1:1)
   - Facebook: 1200x630
   - LinkedIn: 1200x627
   - TikTok: 1080x1920 (9:16)
4. Publish via platform API

```
```

**What to add**: Cron syntax, specific dimensions, concrete hashtags  
**What to keep**: Step-by-step logic, outputs  
**What to cut**: Narrative descriptions  
**Why**: AI agents need executable sequences, not descriptions of what happens

---

### 5. Decision Rules Section

**From Agent Spec:**
```markdown
## DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Autonomous Actions (No Human Needed):**
- Publish scheduled content
- Respond to simple comments with emoji or brief thanks
...

**Escalate to Human (Flag in Notion):**
- Negative comments or complaints
- Press or partnership inquiries
...

**Hard Boundaries:**
- Never post political content
...
```

**To AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
## Decision Rules

### Autonomous Actions
- Publish scheduled content on cadence
- Respond to positive comments with brief thanks or single emoji
- Log all metrics and activity
- Resurface evergreen content (>30 days old, top 10% engagement)

### Escalate to Human
Flag in Notion with `escalation: true` and `urgency: [low|medium|high]`:
- Negative comments or complaints → `urgency: medium`
- Press or partnership inquiries → `urgency: high`
- Viral moments (>10x normal engagement) → `urgency: high`
- Inventory issues (featured product OOS) → `urgency: medium`

### Hard Boundaries (Never Do)
- Post political content or commentary on social issues
- Post sexualized content
- Claim UGC as original without attribution
- Engage with trolls or controversial threads
- Make claims about shipping/guarantees not on puzzlehouse.com
- Feature same product more than 1x/week
```

**What to add**: Urgency levels, specific thresholds  
**What to keep**: The rules themselves  
**Why**: AI agents need decision trees, not principles

---

### 6. Quality Checks Section

**Not typically in Agent Specs—ADD THIS**

**To AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
## Quality Checks

Before publishing any post:
- [ ] Caption is in Ada's voice (warm, unhurried, never salesy)
- [ ] Max 3 emojis used
- [ ] Max 8 hashtags (Instagram), fewer for other platforms
- [ ] Product shown is in stock
- [ ] Image properly sized for platform
- [ ] Not a duplicate of content posted in last 30 days

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Check product inventory status
curl -X GET "https://${SHOPIFY_STORE_URL}/admin/api/2024-01/products/${PRODUCT_ID}.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: ${SHOPIFY_API_KEY}" | jq '.product.variants[0].inventory_quantity'

# Verify image dimensions
identify -format "%wx%h" image.jpg
```
```

**Why add this**: AI coding agents specifically look for verification steps to run after completing work

---

### 7. Guardrails Section

**From Agent Spec:**
```markdown
## CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS
**Quality Control:**
- Vary sentence structure and post formats to avoid robotic patterns
- Never use more than 3 emojis per post
...
```

**To AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
## Guardrails

### Content Rules
- Vary sentence structure (no two consecutive posts should open the same way)
- Max 3 emojis per post
- Max 5-8 hashtags on Instagram, 3-5 on other platforms
- 70% product posts, 30% lifestyle/educational content

### Rate Limits
- Instagram: 25 posts/day, 200 API calls/hour
- Facebook: 50 posts/day
- LinkedIn: 100 posts/day
- TikTok: 50 videos/day

### Budget Constraints

- Evaluate ROI at 90 days
```

**What to add**: Specific rate limits from platform documentation  
**What to keep**: Quality rules, budget constraints  
**Why**: AI agents need hard limits to avoid breaking things

| Situation | Urgency | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Negative comment or complaint | medium | Flag, do not respond |
| Press or partnership inquiry | high | Flag immediately |
| Viral moment (>10x normal engagement) | high | Flag for amplification decision |
| Featured product out of stock | medium | Skip product, flag inventory issue |

### Hard Boundaries (Never Do)
- Post political content or social commentary
- Post sexualized imagery or language
- Use UGC without attribution
- Engage with trolls or controversial threads
- Make claims not on puzzlehouse.com (shipping times, guarantees)
- Feature same product more than 1x per week

## Handling Non-Coding Agents

Your agents (Ada, Aurelius, etc.) are *automation* agents, not *coding* agents. Here's how to adapt:

### For Automation Agents

Instead of:
```markdown
## Testing Instructions
- Run `pnpm test` before committing
```

Use:
```markdown
## Workflow Validation
- Verify n8n workflow executes without errors
- Confirm Notion receives expected data structure
- Check platform API response codes (200 OK)
```

Instead of:
```markdown
## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
```

Use:
```markdown
## Workflow Conventions
- All n8n nodes must have descriptive names
- Error handling required on all API calls
- Logs must include correlation ID for tracing
```

---

## Directory Structure for AI Crew

```
ai-crew/

```

The root `AGENTS.md` contains crew-wide conventions. Nested `AGENTS.md` files contain agent-specific instructions. AI tools read the most specific file for the directory being worked on.

---

## Conversion Checklist

Use this checklist when converting any agent spec:

- [ ] **Identity**: Name, role, voice description, style examples
- [ ] **Mission**: Single sentence with quantifiable targets
- [ ] **Integrations**: All systems with auth details and env vars
- [ ] **Workflows**: Step-by-step with triggers, cron syntax, outputs
- [ ] **Decision Rules**: Autonomous actions, escalation triggers, hard boundaries
- [ ] **Data Schemas**: JSON structures for all data entities
- [ ] **Quality Checks**: Pre-action verification steps with commands
- [ ] **Guardrails**: Rate limits, content rules, budget constraints
- [ ] **Logging**: Standardized log format

---

## Next Steps

1. **Convert existing specs**: Start with Ada (already detailed), then Aurelius
2. **Create root AGENTS.md**: Crew-wide conventions from CONVENTIONS.md
3. **Set up directory structure**: Per the structure above
4. **Test with AI tools**: Use Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex CLI to validate agents can parse and act on the files
